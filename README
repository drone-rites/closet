The clojure-cassandra project is a wrapper around the existing Java Thrift client for the Cassandra database.

***NOTE: This is a pre-release release.  At this time, insertion, retrieval, and removal of simple column families appears to work.  Tests and super column support will be added soon.***

Usage:

(require ['cassandra :as 'db])

(def client (db/make-client "host" port))
(def table (-> client :tables :SomeTable))

(db/put table "key" :family {:col-a [1 2 3 4 5 "six" 7.0]})
(db/put table "key" :family {:col-b "another column"})

;; Get column values
(db/get table "key" :family [:col-a :col-b])
